                  <h3>Hermit’s New EP Out Now!<h3>
                  <h4><time datetime>July 24, 2013</time></h4>
                 <p> Our Boulder-based band,  Hermits have been busily working away on their debut e.p titled “In the Interest of Closing Doors” (a fabulous title I think, which should appeal to all OCD folks and those who fear the cold, or the boogey man!)We’re proud to announce the songs are finished and polished and ready for your listening ears.
                  </p>
                  <h3 itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/MusicGroup">hermits</h3>

                  <span itemprop="description">Hermits are an indie-rock outfit featuring local boys; David DeVine on drums, Eric Michelson on bass, Shevek Majors-Peer on guitar, led by Stanley Beck on vocals and guitar.</span>

                  So head over to itunes to grab your copy of the e.p.

                  Here’s their bio, so you can read a little more about them …. and, go “like” em on facebook folks!

                  The first incarnation of Hermits came to be in 2010, when Stanley Beck and David DeVine started working together on a few of Beck’s songs. They sporadically practiced over the course of 10 months until beginning regular, constant rehearsals to prepare for recording an album. DeVine started tracking drums for the album, “The Black Holes of New England,” in February of 2012. After 6 months of hard work, the album was complete; however, they were in need of a full band in order to blow people’s minds during live shows. They approached Eric Michelson and Shevek Majors-Peer and asked them for their souls (and badass skills.) Michelson and Majors-Peer agreed. They began playing together as the fuller, more cohesive version of Hermits for Beck’s senior thesis show at Naropa University; after a successful first performance, they decided to continue on and keep developing as a band. They are currently looking to rock your socks off in Boulder, Colorado while preparing to release a 2 song EP on Round Barn Recordings. Assuming they don’t blow the world apart with their cacophonous symphonies, Hermits will continue to write and record a second album to be released in 2014.
